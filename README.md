"# MdmFramework" 
Being prepared for distribution (public)

## The Framework
A scholastic and proprietary journey duplicating a few well understood, BIG problems within the .Net C# world. What this project assumed:
* I'm aware good frameworks exist.
* Also, databases typically can import data from disparate environments (assuming the source has an export feature).
* In addition, broad duplication of OS classes within an API is an antipattern.
* An Application Layers abstraction immitating the Network Abstraction Layers is a discussion...

## Mdm Win Link Tool
You will notice many links everywhere. It show the presence of, and widespread usage of Windows shortcuts (links).
* Unless deleted they automagically provide the test data needed for the Win Link Utility.
* After, they provide a great UIX.
* Also, an example for Windows Idomatice Usage Guidelines.
* Regarless, I am aware they introduce a pain amount of paging when viewing the folders in an IDE.

## Mdm Clipboard (C#)
Mentioned here only because it was first built on using the framework. It was easier and faster at the time.

## Mdm Import Utility (C#)
Transfers Schemas and Data between widely disparate platforms. An ETL (extract, transform, load) tool.

## Mdm SRT Tools (search, replace, transform)
Under review.
