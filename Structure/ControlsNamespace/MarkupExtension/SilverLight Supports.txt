Silverlight implements limited support for markup extensions, using only

x:Null, 
StaticResource, 
Binding, and 
TemplateBinding. 

Also, since Silverlight doesn’t implement a public MarkupExtension class, there is no support for custom markup extensions. The Binding markup extension is the only extension that Silverlight supports that has a corresponding class accessible via code.

Silverlight also doesn’t support the alternative syntax of adding the “Extension” suffix like WPF does. So, 

{x:Null} is valid, but 
{x:NullExtension} is not.

Markup extensions, in Silverlight, can not specify constructor parameters by name. Therefore 

{StaticResource myKey} is valid, but 
{StaticResource ResourceKey=myKey} is not.
