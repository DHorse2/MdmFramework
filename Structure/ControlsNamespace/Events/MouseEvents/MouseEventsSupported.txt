In order to obtain right mouse button and wheel support in Silverlight, developers need to interact with the browser through JavaScript and pass the mouse data back to Silverlight. 

Since Silverlight is, at its core, a browser plug-in, it is reliant on the plug-in models of the browser. Most browsers have special handling for the right mouse click and wheel events, and therefore pose a problem for the Silverlight plug-in. However, there are several implementations solving this issue available on the web through the use of browser inter-operation capabilities.
