In addition, the Key enumeration contains different values between Silverlight’s version and WPF’s. For example, Silverlight contains Key.Alt to represent the Alt key, while WPF’s enumeration contains Key.LeftAlt and Key.RightAlt.

WPF also exposed two additional event handlers, PreviewKeyDown and PreviewKeyUp, that Silverlight does not implement.
